API Catalyst is a collection of short, simple API code snippets intended to help you get started using RESTful APIs like [Beats Music](http://developer.beatsmusic.com), [Rotten Tomatoes](http://developer.rottentomatoes.com), [CocaCola Enterprises](http://developer.cokecce.com), [USA TODAY](http://developer.usatoday.com), [The Guardian](http://www.theguardian.com/open-platform), and [World Weather Online](http://developer.worldweatheronline.com).

I've always found code snippets to be one of the best ways to get started with an API/SDK. Often times all you wanna know is how to make an API call and get some meaningful results. Much like a catalyst, code snippets make the process of learning and playing around with APIs a lot faster, easier and fun. 

API Catalyst code snippets are currently available for Ruby and Javascript.
